Instruction
This expense tracker allows users to record and track their expenses. They can choose to add expense, view expense, calculate their total expense, and delete expenses. When they choose to add expense, users will be required to input their expense, the date of the expense, and where did they spend this money on. When they choose to view expense, all the recored will be automatically filtered and displayed with index number and in the order of Category, Date and then Amount. When they choose to delete the expense, they can simply just choose the category and type in the index number that they want to delete.

Task & Responsibilities
In our expense tracker project, Emory was responsible for developing all the core functions, including add_expense(), view_expense(), calculate_total_expense(), and delete_expense(). These functions handled essential tasks such as adding new expenses, displaying them by category, calculating total expenses, and allowing users to remove specific entries. Emory also structured the data storage using a list of dictionaries, ensuring that expenses were well-organized and easily accessible. Meanwhile, I focused on implementing the main program flow by designing the while loop that allowed users to navigate between different options efficiently. Additionally, I was responsible for debugging and fixing errors, including incorrect function calls, dictionary key issues, and improper handling of user input. I added try-except blocks to prevent crashes and ensured that expenses were properly linked between categories and the main list when deleting them. To enhance code readability and maintainability, I optimized variable names, structured functions logically, and added comments and docstrings for clarity. Together, we tested and refined the program to ensure it functioned smoothly, making it user-friendly and efficient.

Challenge
When we were collaborating, we did enjoy the process of brainstorming and solving problems together. However, we did face a few challenges, and the biggest challenge was that our codes did match when we tried to combined our parts together. For example, when naming the define function and lists, we used different names without discuss, which caused a few errors and issues when we were trying to combine them together, and this problem took us some times to fix.
