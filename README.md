In our expense tracker project, Emory was responsible for developing all the core functions, including add_expense(), view_expense(), calculate_total_expense(), and delete_expense(). These functions handled essential tasks such as adding new expenses, displaying them by category, calculating total expenses, and allowing users to remove specific entries. Emory also structured the data storage using a list of dictionaries, ensuring that expenses were well-organized and easily accessible. Meanwhile, I focused on implementing the main program flow by designing the while loop that allowed users to navigate between different options efficiently. Additionally, I was responsible for debugging and fixing errors, including incorrect function calls, dictionary key issues, and improper handling of user input. I added try-except blocks to prevent crashes and ensured that expenses were properly linked between categories and the main list when deleting them. To enhance code readability and maintainability, I optimized variable names, structured functions logically, and added comments and docstrings for clarity. Together, we tested and refined the program to ensure it functioned smoothly, making it user-friendly and efficient.
